# Segmentation-with-VGG16-U-Net

## Overview

This project implements a semantic segmentation model using a U-Net architecture with a VGG16 backbone. The VGG16 model is used as the encoder to extract feature maps, and the U-Net architecture helps in pixel-wise classification for semantic segmentation tasks. This model is trained and tested on images with corresponding masks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (for executing the code with .ipynb)

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install them:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
